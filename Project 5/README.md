To stay competitive in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, your organization regularly analyzes data to identify emerging and future skill requirements.

Roles and responsibilities:
As a Data Analyst, you will contribute to this initiative by collecting data from diverse sources and identifying trends for this year's report on in-demand skills.

After collecting sufficient data, you will analyze it to identify key insights and trends. Some of the trends you will explore include:

Once the data is prepared, you will employ statistical techniques to analyze the data, identifying key trends and insights. You will then synthesize your findings using IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard that visualizes the results. Finally, you will share your insights through a presentation, showcasing your storytelling and data analysis skills.
